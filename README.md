# REST_API-Django
API REST con Django

In this project, I developed a RESTful API using Django, a powerful and flexible web framework for building web applications, along with Django REST Framework (DRF), a robust toolkit specifically designed for building Web APIs. This combination provides an efficient and scalable solution for creating, managing, and exposing API endpoints.

Key Features:

Django Framework:

Utilized Django's robust MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture to structure the application.
Leveraged Django's built-in ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact seamlessly with the database, enabling efficient data manipulation and retrieval.
Django REST Framework:

Implemented DRF to create a fully functional and browsable REST API.
Utilized serializers to convert complex data types, such as querysets and model instances, into native Python data types that can then be easily rendered into JSON or XML.
Applied viewsets and routers to automatically generate URL routes and organize views for better maintainability and scalability.
Incorporated authentication and permission classes to secure API endpoints, ensuring only authorized users have access to specific resources.

API Functionality:
Developed endpoints for POST and GET on various resources.

Technologies Used:
- Backend: Django, Django REST Framework
- Database: SQLite
